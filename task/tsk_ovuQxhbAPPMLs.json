Thus, instead of a simple category of anomia, naming difficulties may be rank ordered along a continuum. Items on the BNT are ordered according to their ability to be named, which is thought to be correlated with their frequency. This type of picture-naming vocabulary test is useful in the examination of children with learning disabilities and the evaluation of adults with brain injury or dysfunction. <br><br>(from Roth, C.
