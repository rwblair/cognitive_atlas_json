First-stage choices are primarily associated with one of two second-stages (labeled 2a and 2b): one first-stage choice leads to 2a 70% of the time and 2b 30% of the time, while the opposite is true of the other first-stage choice. Each second-stage choice has its own probability of reward (constantly changing via a random-walk). The ultimate goal of the subject is to maximize reward, which are only given during the second stage. The ideal subject would identify the most rewarding second-stage stimulus and make first-stage choices that make it more likely to arrive at the relevant second stage.
