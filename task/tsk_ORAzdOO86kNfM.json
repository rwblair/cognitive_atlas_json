The task reliably identifies these brain regions in individual subjects using fMRI, by contrasting neural responses to meaningful and structured language stimuli vs. stimuli matched for low-level properties but lacking meaning and/or structure. In particular, responses to auditorily presented excerpts from engaging interviews or stories are contrasted vs. acoustically degraded versions of these materials.
